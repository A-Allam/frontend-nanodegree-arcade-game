# frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This code is the result I achieved for ***[Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001) - Project 3: Classic Arcade Game Clone***.

This code has been *reviewed by me*. According to me, based on the rubric used
by the Udacity reviewer, this code at least meets specifications on all the
criteria.

The reference that has been of great help to me was the [JavaScript
documentation at the Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

## The Game

The player starts at the bottom of the board. The user has to move the player to the top of the board, over the road into the water, while avoiding enemies crossing the road.
When the player succeeds, or when the player has been hit by one of the
enemies, the game will be reset to the initial state.


### Controls

* The player can be moved with the ***arrow keys***
* if the player reach water he win point
