===============================

This code is the result I achieved for ***[Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001) - Project 3: Classic Arcade Game Clone***.

This code has been *reviewed by me*. According to me, based on the rubric used
by the Udacity reviewer, this code at least meets specifications on all the
criteria.

The reference that has been of great help to me was the [JavaScript
documentation at the Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

### How to play

* The player can be moved with the ***arrow keys***
* if the player reach water he win point 

Good Luck!
